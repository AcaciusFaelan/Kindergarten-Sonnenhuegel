- **Deckblatt (Cover Page):** Yes, included.
- **Automatisch generiertes Inhaltsverzeichnis (Automatically generated Table of Contents):** Yes, included and is automatically generated.
- **Einleitung (Introduction):** Yes, the "Projektbeschreibung" serves as an introduction.
- **Erläuterung zu der erstellten Seite (Explanation of the created page):** Yes, this is done well with screenshots and descriptions for each page.

## Conclusion

The documentation provides a good overview of the project. It is well-structured and covers most of the required aspects. A user can understand the project's purpose, its visual appearance, and get a glimpse into the technical implementation. With the correction about the table of contents, it now aligns better with the stated assignment requirements.

Furthermore, for a technical documentation, it is **incomplete**. While it explains parts of the HTML and a small JavaScript snippet, it completely omits any description or examples of the CSS code, which is a critical part of the website's implementation.

### Strengths

*   **Clear Structure:** The document is easy to follow.
*   **Visual Aids:** Screenshots effectively demonstrate the final product.
*   **Transparency:** Honest and clear reporting on the use of external resources like stock photos and AI.
*   **Code explanations:** The provided code snippets are accompanied by explanations of their function.

### Weaknesses


*   **Incomplete Technical Details:** The documentation for the code is not comprehensive. It lacks any information about the CSS, and only shows very specific parts of the HTML and JavaScript.
*   **Superficial Code Explanations:** The explanations for the code are very basic and don't go into much depth.
